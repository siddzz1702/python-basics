🔐 Python Excel Password Manager

A simple password manager built with Python that stores login IDs and passwords securely in an Excel file.
Each user has their own sheet, which is protected by a PIN. Passwords are encrypted using Fernet (AES-128) so that even if someone opens the Excel file directly, the stored credentials remain unreadable.

🚀 Features

Multiple users, each with a unique PIN

Store credentials for apps, websites, and emails

Add, View, Update, Delete credentials

All sensitive data stored in encrypted form

Works with Excel (.xlsx) using openpyxl

Runs in terminal with an interactive menu

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.8+

Required libraries:

cryptography

openpyxl

Install them with:

pip3 install cryptography openpyxl


or (if pip3 is not available):

python3 -m pip install cryptography openpyxl

📂 Project Files

password_manager.py → main program

password_manager.xlsx → auto-generated Excel file storing credentials

secret.key → encryption key (must be kept safe!)

▶️ Usage

Run the script:

python3 password_manager.py


You will see a menu like this:

--- Password Manager ---
1. Create User
2. Add Password
3. View Passwords
4. Update Password
5. Delete Password
6. Exit

Example Workflow

Create User → Set a username and a PIN

Add Password → Enter App/Email, Login ID, and Password

View Passwords → Enter your PIN to decrypt and view credentials

Update/Delete Passwords → Select entry number to modify or remove

🔐 Security Notes

All PINs and passwords are stored encrypted using Fernet (AES-based).

Without the secret.key file, the Excel contents are unreadable.

Do not delete or share the secret.key file — losing it means losing access to all passwords.

⚠️ Limitations

This is a basic password manager for learning/demo purposes.

It does not replace professional password managers like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass.

The Excel file is not password-protected itself; protection happens only through this Python program.

💡 Future Improvements

Add search by app/email

Export/import backup option

GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt

Convert to a standalone .exe / .app
