# Python Practice Programs - After Completing "Programming for Everybody"

This repository contains practice codes I worked on after completing the **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)** course on Coursera.  
These exercises reinforce my understanding of **loops, conditionals, functions, and error handling**.

##Programs

###  1. Even / Odd Number Checker
- Prompts the user for integers.
- Identifies whether the number is **even or odd**.
- Handles invalid input gracefully.

### 2. Simple Calculator
- Takes two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Performs the calculation and prints the result.
- Handles invalid numbers and operations using `try/except`.

### 3. Guess the Number Game
- Picks a random number between 1 and 20.
- The user keeps guessing until they find the number.
- Provides feedback ("too high", "too low") for each guess.
- Ends when the correct guess is made or the user types `done`.

##  Math Progress
Alongside Python, I am also revising **matrices** in mathematics (linear algebra basics), which is important for machine learning and AI.

##  Next Steps
- Start the **Python Data Structures** course (Coursera).
- Continue adding mini-projects (ATM Simulator, Password Manager, etc.).
- Push progress to **GitHub** and share updates fortnightly on **LinkedIn**.
