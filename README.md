# 🚀 My AI Journey

Hi! I'm Siddhant, a Mechanical Engineering graduate starting my transition into AI & Data Science.  
This repo documents my **daily progress** in learning Python, AI, and related technologies from scratch.

## 📅 Daily Log
- **Day 1 (16th Aug 2025):** Created my first Python script - *Hello AI World!*
- **Day 2 (17th Aug 2025)**
- Learned about Python variables, data types, and basic operators.  
- Practiced with simple input/output programs:  
  - **Age Calculator** (`day2_age_calculator.py`) → asks user’s age and returns birth year.  
  - **Temperature Converter** (`day2_temp_converter.py`) → Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit.    
- Maths Progress: Completed **Vectors** → addition, subtraction, dot product, magnitude, unit vector.  
- (Extra) Added Python implementation of vector operations: `day2_vectors.py`-
-  **Day 3 (18th Aug 2025)**
- Learned `if`, `elif`, `else` statements.  
- Practiced decision-making with:  
  - **Overtime Pay Calculator** (`day3_overtime_pay.py`) → regular + 1.5x overtime pay.  
  - **Grading System** (`day3_grading_system.py`) → assigns grades based on score.  
- Mini Project:
-ATM Simulator (Python)
**Overview**

This is a simple ATM Simulator built in Python using if-else statements and user input.
It allows users to:
Perform basic banking operations like:

✅ Check Balance

✅ Deposit Money

✅ Withdraw Money

✅ Exit

This project helps practice conditional logic, loops, and user input handling in Python.
**Future Improvements**
1)Allow multiple user accounts.
2)Take PIN
3)Mask PIN input (hide while typing).
4)Save transaction history.
5)Store balance in a file or database. 
**Day 4(19 August 2025)**
**This project combines multiple small Python practice programs into a single menu-driven application.**
Features:
1)Print Numbers (1–10)
2)Prints numbers using both while and for loops.
3)Helps understand repetition and iteration.
4)Multiplication Table
5)Prints the multiplication table of any number.
6)Reinforces use of for loop and arithmetic.
7)Sum & Factorial of a Number
8)Calculates sum of first N natural numbers.
9)Computes factorial of N.
10)Demonstrates accumulation patterns in loops.
11)Exit Option
**More updates will follow as I progress...)**
