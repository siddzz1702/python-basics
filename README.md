# 🚀 My AI Journey

Hi! I'm Siddhant, a Mechanical Engineering graduate starting my transition into AI & Data Science.  
This repo documents my **daily progress** in learning Python, AI, and related technologies from scratch.

---

## 📅 Daily Log
- **Day 1 (16th Aug 2025):** Created my first Python script - *Hello AI World!*
- **Day 2 (17th Aug 2025)**
- Learned about Python variables, data types, and basic operators.  
- Practiced with simple input/output programs:  
  - **Age Calculator** (`day2_age_calculator.py`) → asks user’s age and returns birth year.  
  - **Temperature Converter** (`day2_temp_converter.py`) → Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit.    
- Maths Progress: Completed **Vectors** → addition, subtraction, dot product, magnitude, unit vector.  
- (Extra) Added Python implementation of vector operations: `day2_vectors.py` - *(More updates will follow as I progress...)*
